====== Martins Objections to the Incarnation ======
Created Friday 16 February 2018

**Martin's Objectiosn Summarized**

A. //Contradictory Attributes://
	1. Attributes of a person's mind(s) are predicated of the person who bears the mind(s).
	2. On Christian doctrine, in virtue of His divine mind, Christ is omniscient.
	3. Therefore, the person Christ is both omniscient and not omniscient.
	4. Nothing can be both F and not-F, where F is some feature of attribute.
	5. Therefore, Christian doctrine concerning the Incarnation is false.
B. //Two Minds://
	1. Anything with two minds has two independent centers of rational agency.
	2. No single person has two independent centers of rational agency.
	3. Therefore, no single person can have two minds.
	4. On Christian doctrine, Christ is one person with two minds.
	5. Therefore, Christian doctrine about Christ is false.
C. //Christ's Temptation://
	1. S is tempted to sin only if S is attracted to doing something immoral.
	2. A morally perfect being could not be attracted to doing something immoral.
	3. On Christian doctrine, Christ is both a morally perfect being and was tempted to sin
	4. Therefore, Christian doctrine is false.
D. //Christ as Model://
	1. S is a moral model for human beings only if S at some time is attracted to doing something immoral.
	2. Christ cannot be attracted to doing anything immoral.
	3. Therefore, Christ is not a moral model for human beings.
E. //Christ's Praiseworthiness://
	1. S's lack of attraction to a sinful act is praiseworthy only if S at some time felt an attraction to that sinful act and overcame it by conscious effort.
	2. Christ never felt attraction to any sinful act.
	3. Therefore, Christ's lack of attraction to sinful acts is not praiseworthy.
F. //Against the Reasonableness of Christian Belief://
	1. Christian belief relies on Spirit Epistemology.
	2. Any belief that relies on Spirit Epistemology is not reasonable.
		a. Any belief that relies on Spirit Epistemology has the same epistemic status as the beliefs of followers of Apollonius, who have an Apollonius Epistemology (=those whose impediments have been removed by God can see that Apollonius is God incarnate).
		b. The beliefs of followers of Apollonius are not reasonable.
	3. Christian belief is not reasonable
G. //Evidence for the Incarnation://
	1. Miracles do not rationally support the belief that Jesus is the Son of God.
		a. Miracles can be worked by persons who are not the Son of God.
		b. There is not enough justification to believe that Jesus worked miracles.
	2. Jesus' moral example does not rationally support the belief taht Jesus is the Son of God.
		a. Moral perfection is possible for persons other than the Son of God.
		b. Jesus was not an ideal moral example.
	3. Belief in the Incarnation can be rationally supported only by Jesus' miracles and moral example.
	4. Therefore, belief in the Incarnation is not rationally supported.
