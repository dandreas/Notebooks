**Reading: **Atonement by Stump; Ch 4 ([[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1C4ikmJMxh3KuSX2o97uGKrmkiEYDlZjd|Drive]])
1. The indwelling of the HS is not causal or cognitive access.
	a. Omnipresence vs omniscience
		1. **Omniscience**: God knows all things (in this sense he is present in our minds, since he knows our thoughts)
		2. **Omnipresence**: God is present causally everywhere
2. **Mind Reading**: for Stump this is essentially an empathetic reaction where you intuitively experience/know emotional states desires or experiences of others.
	a. Feelings are material, and therefore the DN cannot have feelings
	b. Since mind reading is a reading of feelings, it is a function of material things
	c. Therefore it is through the HN of Christ that he is able to mind read
3. Significant Personal Presence:
	a. Mutual closeness:
		1. Not always a symmetric relation
			a. (Jill is close to Jack) does not seem to imply (Jack is close to Jill)
		2. Intransitive
			a. **Transitive**: If A is related to B and B is related to C then A is related to C
			b. If a mother is close to her son, and her son is close to his wife, it need not be the case that the mother is close to her son's wife.
		3. A is close to B when:
			a. B is sharing their deepest thoughts and desires to A
			b. A would then be dear to B, but B would not necessarily be close to A
	b. Shared attention
		1. Eye gaze
			a. Provides mutual awareness of shared attention
		2. If a human finds shared attention difficult (or uncomfortable)
			a. Language is affected
			b. Less ability for mind reading / emotional resonance
		3. Joint attention is second person
			a. Having joint attention/shared attention is when the word "you" is used
		4. Significant personal presence occurs when each of the people have shared attention to eachother
		5. Distance impedes shared attention and thus significant personal presence
		6. God can share this both because of the knowledge of his DN and because of his HN in Christ
			a. In the HS indwelling, God himself is supposed somehow to be within each person in grace
			b. This indwelling is ontologically higher than shared attention/mutual closeness.
