====== 2-12-18 Individuation ======
Created Monday 12 February 2018

Notes:
1. Individuation of material substances:
	a. **Individuation**: What makes a thing separate or distinct from other things.
	b. How this is achieved:
		1. Soul individuates Peter from Paul.
		2. Souls are individuated by "matter under indeterminate dimensions = "signate matter."
			a. Due to matter being:
				1. extension
				2. space filling
				3. place occupying
2. Doctrine on Christ: one person in two natures:
	a. One substance in Christ.
		a. (person = an individual substance of a rational nature)
		b. => One person in Christ
		c. Christ is a composite person
			a. One "constituent" of Christ is the divine nature
			b. The other "constituent" of Christ is a complete human nature.
		d. Christ's human nature is united to the Word in a unity of person
		e. => Christ's having a complete human nature does not entail two persons in Christ
	b. (ST P3 Q4 A2) http://www.newadvent.org/summa/4004.htm#article2
	c. Both of these natures must be joined in some fashion:
		g. Christ has the divine nature and has filiation to the Father, though they are not distinct due to simplicity of the divine nature.
		h. Christ's human nature is substantial form + prime matter
	d. 3 Answers:
		1. The second person of the trinity and Christ's human nature become parts of Christ.
			a. Divine nature does not enter into composition.
		2. CHN becomes a part of the second person of the trinity
			a. Divine nature is simple and can have no parts.
		3. Habitus: Christ's human nature is in the second person like an accident.
			i. Doesn't seem to violate divine simplicity as much?
			j. An accidental union however is not a unity of person
