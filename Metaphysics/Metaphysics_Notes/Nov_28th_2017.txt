* Paper deadline extended!

=== Outline: ===
1. Augros Chapter 3: Is the First Cause matter or energy?
	a. Simple:
		1. Matter is subject to motion.
		2. The first cause is not subject to motion [change of place].
			a. Motion depends on something else or on itself
				1. Motion requires something to be moving, and something doing the moving
					a. To move something is to give motion to it
						1. Can the first cause be a self-mover
							a. Principle: Nothing can give and recieve to itself the same thing at the same time.
							b. => The first cause cannot be a self mover
						2. To be moved is to recieve motion from it
							a. The first cause cannot recieve motion for other things, or it would not be a first cause
		3. But, neither option is possible for the first cause
		4. (C) So, matter is not the first cause
2. Augros Chapter 4: Is God (and everything else) a body?
	a. Reasons:
		1. Argument by imagination
			a. If something is imaginable, then it can exist
			b. Imagination is a guide to possibility
			c. I can't imagine something without dimension (size,shape,location)
			d. So, dimensionless being cannot exist
		2. Simpler the thing, the simpler the idea
			a. If something is going to be the most fundamental thing, it should be the most simple idea, such as a basic particle
		3. Argument from act
			a. Whatever is real must be capable of acting or being acted upon
			b. Nothing acts on anything without contact
			c. Contact requires a body
			d. => Nothing without a body is real
	b. Replies:
		1. Against the arg by imagination
			a. Invalid because we can imagine things that are impossible, such as aging in reverse
			b. If it is possible it is imaginable, you still are not claiming that things that are not imaginable are impossible.
		2. Against simple arg
			a. Lines have a simpler idea, yet are a more complex thing than points
		3. Against act arg
			a. Premise (b) is false, and gives no support.
