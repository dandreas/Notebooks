Rough Sketch of Scientia:
1. Organized body of knowledge
	a. Broader than contemporary science
2. Perfect knowledge of things through their causes
	a. Not merely an instance of knowing //that //something is the case (x is a plant)
	b. Knowing //why //something is the case (this is what would make something x a plant)
3. Goal of inquiry
	a. "Men do not think that they know a thing until they know its causes"
4. Scientia is reached when the causal structure of beliefs mirrors the causal structure of the world.
	a. The basis for a belief for a person with scientia on a thing will be qualitatively different than one without.
		1. A mokey is eating rocks, you and an expert see it.
		2. The monkey as you see it is eating rocks
		3. The monkey as the expert sees it is eating rocks because of the causal structure that make the monkey eat the rocks.
5. Requires all 3 acts of the mind [[Nov 28 2017|(Nov 28 2017)]]
	a. Concepts 
	b. Judgement
	c. Reasoning
Syllogism and the Whyagram
1. __Syllogism:__ a valid argument composed of three terms and 3 //categorial propositions//.
	a. __categorial propositions:__ Propositions with 1 subject and 1 predicate and no connectives.
2. The Standard Example:
	a. All //men// are //mortal //(Major Premise)
	b. //Socrates// is a //man //(Minor premise
	c. //Socrates// is //mortal//
		1. Subject of the conclusion is always the __Minor term __ (Socrates)
		2. The predicate of the conclusion is always the __Major term __ (mortal)
		3. The subject of the first premise is always the __Middle term __ (Men)
3. Whyagram
	a. Method used to produce an argument stating why the conclusion is so.
	b. Example:
		1. Proving that cats are mammals.
		2. cats || are mammals
		3. Why is it so that cats are mammals? 
		4. x(mammal/cat intercept): //Makes milk and have hair//
		5. Choose a quantifier (whatever)
			a. Whatever //makes milk and has hair// are mammals.
			b. Cats //make milk and have hair//.
			c. Cats are mammals.
	c. Another Example:
		1. Proving tomatoes are fruits
		2. Tomatoes|| are fruits
			a. x(Tomatoe/fruit intercept): //seed containing vehicles of plant reproduction//.
			b. Choose a quantifier (whatever)
				1. Whatever is a //seed containing vehicle of pland reproduction // are fruits.
				2. Tomatoes are //seed containing vehicles of plant reproduction.//
				3. Tomatoes are fruits.
For scientia, the premises of the argument must meet "priority conditions."
1. Successful scientia producing demonstration:
	a. All vines are broad-leaved
	b. All broad-leaved plants are sap-congealers at the leaf stalk.
	c. All sap-congealers at the leaf stalk are deciduous
	d. Therefore, all vines are deciduous (deciduous: leaves fall off in the fall)
2. Features of the premises:
	a. Each premise is necessarily true.
	b. Each premise is true per se.
		1. In accord with its nature.
	c. Each premise is prior to the conclusion.
	d. Each premise is true
	e. Each premise states the cause.
	f. The premises are immediate.
	g. The premises are primitive
		1. Each premise of a scientific demonstration must be a primitive truth.
		2. Each predicate in the premises must be said primitively of the subject.
		3. What does this mean?
			a. Not merely universally said.
				1. A predicate is said universally of a thing when it is said of all the members of a thing
				2. Not universally said: All goats are female (false, cannot be said of each and every one of the kind)
				3. Is universally said: All goats have internal organs. (true, can be said of each and every one of the kind)
				4. point: A predicate said primitively is said universally of its subject, but not merely that.
			b. A predicate said primitively is said per se, but not merely that
				1. All humans are rational.
				2. All humans are bodily.
			c. A predicate said primitively belongs to the subject per se, but not to anything outside of the subject's genus.
				1. Shorthand: The predicate is per se and uniquely true of the subject.
		4. Examples:
			a. Not primitive: All humans are bodily. (not only humans are bodily)
			b. Not primitive: All plants are made of cells. (not only plants are made of cells)
			c. Is primitive: All humans are risible (capacity for laughter). (only humans have this capacity)
			d. is primitive: All broad leafed plants are sap-congealers at the leaf stalk. (only broad leafed plants are sap-congealers at the leaf stalk)
		5. Primitive truths are convertable
			a. All (a)s are (b)s and all (b)s are (a)s
