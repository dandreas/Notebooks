* There will be notes in the handout-text.

=== Assorted Notes: ===
1. Epistemology as Lexicology
	a. General format: "S knows that p"
		1. Case: Blake is a knight
		2. Blake is a knight only if Blake is indomitable in battle
		3. only if she rules her realm with wisdom
		4. only if she makes women swoon
		5. only if always courteous in public and private
		6. only if she has subtle but perfect fashion sense
			a. After this, you ask "is anyone a knight?"
			b. It seems like nobody meets the full requirements
	b. When we are studying a term lexicologically, we are studying the sufficient conditions for something in the world to reflect the way we refer to the term linquistically.
