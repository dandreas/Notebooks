===== Remainder of knower and known reading: =====
How exactly can the knower be correlated with the known?:
	The form which is binded to matter is the same which informs the intellect, but works in a different way, since the intellect has no matter.


== Intentionality: ==
1. __Intentionality__ is the feature of mental states that makes them of or about things besides themselves
2. What makes a state to be an intentional state?
	a. Being isomorphic to some other set of states or features/properties.
	b. The source of intentionality of mental states is the intentionality of //nature//
3. Problems:
	a. (a) Isomorphism is insufficient for intentionality
		1. there is a 1 to 1 mapping between 2 identical stones, perfect isomorphism, neither has intentional states. Therefore, isomorphic states do not have intentionality.
		2. 2 dogs have the same form, but they don't //know //eachother because of this.
		3. Isomorphism is a 2 way street, so if fido is isomorphic to spot, vice versa is true. Intentionality however is a 1 way street. Isomorphism is insufficient for intentionality because it gives a 2 way street and intent is a 1 way street
	b. (a)Not even Thomistic sameness of form is sufficient for intentionality
	c. (a)Not even Thomistic sameness of form plus causation is sufficient for intentionality
		1. An oak tree has the form of oak tree. It drops an acorn falls into the ground and grows into an oak tree. 
			a. They both have the same form
			b. The first oak tree is the cause of the form of the second oak tree
			c. But, though we have sameness of form and causation in this scenario, this doesnt seem to be intentional.
4. Positive conception of intentionality
	a. Due to the issues with (a) we must pose (b)
	b. Nature provides intentionality to thought and knowledge
	c. My cognitive powers are directed to the world, and they are means by which I achieve my end which involves knowledge of truth.
		1. I by my nature am directed toward an end
			a. Rational activity in accord with virtue (the highest virtue)
			b. The development and use of virtue
			c. All of these things help fulfil the end, which is pursuit of truth
			d. The cognitive powers are directed by this natural inclination
	d. Sameness of form in my intellect is the means by which my cognitive powers are directed towards this or that kind of thing

== Truth: ==
1. __Truth__ is the //adequation// of the mind to the thing.
	a. Involves 2 things:
		1. towards (ad)
		2. equality (equation)
2. The world is the //measure// of the mind's equality to reality
3. What in the mind can be true?
4. Not the mind's first act
	a. Acts of the mind:
		1. Simple apprehension
			a. What a dog is
			b. Can be incomplete **but is not subject to being in actual error**
		2. Judgement
			a. Sentences or propositions about the thing, combines different concepts
			b. A //dog// is a //material// thing
		3. Reasoning
			a. Arguments
			b. All men are mortal
			c. Socrates is a man
			d. => Socrates is mortal
5. Simple apprehension cannot be true or false
	a. Equality b/w real things requires distinction among them
	b. Superman can't be called the equal of Clark Kent
	c. This can't be said because there is no formal difference between the first act of the mind and the object of apprehension
6. Truth is found in the second act of the mind
	a. Judgements have propositional structure, things in the world do not have propositional structure.
	b. Whether or not the judgement is correct is determined by the way the world actually is
