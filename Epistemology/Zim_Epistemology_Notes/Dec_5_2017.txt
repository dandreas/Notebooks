=== Scientia ===
1. __Scientia__: perfect cognition of a thing through its causes
	a. Requires understanding
	b. Requires such a complete understanding of the causes of something, that ones understanding of that thing is grounded in the causes.
2. How to apply scientia to particulars
	a. Original argument (that doesn't work for scientia)
		1. All vines are broad leaved
		2. All broad leaved plants are sap-congealers at the leaf stalk
		3. All sap congealers at the leaf stalk are deciduous
		4. => All vines are deciduous
	b. Doesn't work because p1 isn't primitive
	c. Revised argument (part 1, scintific demonstration proper)
		1. All broad leaved plants are sap-congealers at the leaf stalk
		2. All sap-congealers at the leaf stalk are deciduous
		3. => All broad leaved plants are deciduous
	d. (part 2, application)
		1. All vines are broad leaved
		2. (3) All broad leaved plants are deciduous
		3. => All vines are deciduous
3. Finishing off priority condition on the premises
	a. Premises must state truths prior in being to the conclusion.
	b. Premises must state the causes of the conclusion.
	c. Premises must be immediate.
	d. (You can't make a whyagram)
		1. foundationalism?
4. Comparison to contemporary theories of knowledge
	a. Seriously restricted scope.
	b. To have scientia, //lots //of knowledge is already required
		1. movement from knowledge to more perfect knowledge
	c. The theory of scientia is a non-skeptical foundationalist theory.
5. Some questions about our knowledge of first principles
	a. Could one really expect to know all first principles of the various sciences?
	b. Can we really know first principles non-inferentially?
	c. Can we know the premises of scientific demonstrations better than the conclusions?
6. Indefectibility Doctrine
	a. __Indifectibility Doctrine:__ The intellect is indefectible (cannot be false) in its first operation of knowing the essences of things.
	b. 2 refinements:
		1. The intellect in its first operation is "infallible" insofar as it is neither true nor false.
		2. The intellect in its first operation is always veratious

=== Analytic Synthetic ===
1. Analytic truths: truths based solely on minds and the meaning of terms
2. Synthetic truths: truths based upon looking at the world (not simply based on the meanings of terms)
3. arguing for 6b2:
	a. The first operation of the intellect is the grasp of analytic truths.
4. Reply:
	a. When you know the subject, you must know the predicate as well.
	b. This means analytic truths can have analytic predicates
	c. If you cannot know analytic truths without knowing the predicates
	d. This is too strong, since you should be able to know something partially through the first act of the intellect.
